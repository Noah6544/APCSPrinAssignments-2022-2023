# APCSPrinAssignments-2022-2023
Assignments for my APCSPrinciplesClass during the 2022-2023 school year (My Junior Year).
I had a bad opinion on Java coming from python, but this class set me up perfectly to learn javaScript and get into webdev. I kinda like semicolons now.
My teacher structures this class such that both CSA and CSP pretty much do the same thing.
I think that my teacher has to be one of the best CS teachers around. Thank you for everything Mr. Smith. 

Let me know if you want me to take these down, because it is answers to your labs, but I don't think anyone will really see this. Just uploading this so I can come back to JAVA reference when I want to.
